## Summary

An initial API for resolving matches between states. This API is currently only used by the Query and Collaboration Tool, but is built with an eye toward future state integration.

The Match Resolution API is implemented in the `Piipan.Match.Func.ResolutionApi` project and deployed to an Azure Function App.

OpenApi schema is defined [here](./openapi/resolution/index.yaml).


## Environment variables

| Name | |
|---|---|
| `CollaborationDatabaseConnectionString` | [details](../../docs/iac.md#\:\~\:text=CollaborationDatabaseConnectionString) â€” Additionally, `Database` is set to the placeholder value `{database}`. The relevant per-state database name is inserted at run-time as needed. |
| `States` | [details](../../docs/iac.md#\:\~\:text=States) |
